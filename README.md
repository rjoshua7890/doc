# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

 React + Vite Project

This is a React application set up using Vite as the build tool.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   cd <project-directory>

   npm install
    
    
Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
   
   npm run dev

You should see output indicating that the server is running, typically at http://localhost:5000.

Open your browser and navigate to that URL to view the application.

bash

npm run build

The built files will be generated in the dist directory.
